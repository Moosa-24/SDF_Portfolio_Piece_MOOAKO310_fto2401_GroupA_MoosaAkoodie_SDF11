i forgot to show that the anchor tags in the nav bar take me to javascript:void(0)

i also forgot to show that the href tags for the google maps thing works,
you can just click on it and it should work fine

i had issues with github again and had to manually add all html and readme changes, I came to the conclusion that it's a naming issue becuase the terminal said my file(which i copied the name of) doesn't exist.. but when i made a new test repo and followed the steps to push changes it worked perfectly, unfortunately i had to keep the naming convention as is so i couldn't push changes the way i would have wanted to
